UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from
0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annota-
tions of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, fa-
cial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. The labels of each image
are embedded in the file name, formatted as [age] [gender] [race] [date&time].jpg.

Ethical disclaimer: 
We acknowledge that some people might feel uncom- fortable about using this dataset, such as predicting a person’s age and gender purely based on his/her appearance, only female and male included in the gen- der label, etc. 
We don’t consider moral issues simply because we only use it for a ML exercise for this course. 
However, you MUST consider potential moral issues when using any dataset in your future research or career.
